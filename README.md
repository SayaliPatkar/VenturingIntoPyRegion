# VenturingIntoPyRegion
As a long time Java developer, it was a difficult task moving away from that defense level coding discipline and work with language developed for making programming 'sexy'. It's frustrating how difficult it is to un-molding mind.  Here I will add code that I specifically written to understand certain concepts related to python and tensorflow. I am adding this public repository only hoping that some lost person like me will find it helpful ;)
