# VenturingIntoPyRegion
As a long time Java developer, it was a difficult task moving away from that defense level coding discipline and work with language developed for making programming 'sexy'. It's frustrating how difficult it is to un-molding mind.  
  
Here I will add code that I have specifically written to familiarize myself with certain concepts related to python and tensorflow. I am adding this public repository only hoping that some lost soul like me will find some solace here ;).   
  
To all those pro-py_developers, hope I will join the league one day.
